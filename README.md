# EMS22A-Teensy4.1

A simple bitbanging library to use the Bourns EMS22A Rotary Encoder with a Teensy 4.1

The EMS22A rotary encoder is an excellent choice, but it has a slightly weird protocol that is very timing dependent. This particular implementation is timed precisely for good results on the Teensy 4.1.
